        <h4>About the Author</h4>
        <p>The author of this extension is Garrett Emrick. I am a senior at Miami University of Oxford, and this is my
        first extension I created, which I did all of the work at a hackathon.</p><p> I don't plan on updating it, unless people really
        enjoy it. Then I may improve upon it further.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="search">
        <h4>How to Search</h4>
        <p>In order to do a search, there are a couple of things that you can do. You can either right click or highlight a name while browsing,
        such as a friends name on facebook, and you will then be prompted to make corrections/changes to the final name. You should
        remove nicknames and abbreviations for the best search.</p>
        <p>You can also use this popup at any time to do a search using the search line above.</p>

        <h4>Future Plans</h4>
        <p>At the moment, I don't really have any future plans. I am just publishing this so people can have fun with it. But, if I were to update it I would add:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Better Search: Search more databases and in other countries for a more extensive search.</li>
            <li>In addition to mentioned above, I have already found an API I plan to replace it with. This is much more extensive and more flexible...</li>
            <li>Better interface: Currently it's not too flashy, and there is no icon. If there's interest in this extension I will fix that</li>
            <li>Automatic Search: Have the page automatically do background checks of names it finds on the web page, and display their record in a popup next to their name</li>
            <li>Perhaps more. I haven't thought too much about it, this is just something I created for fun.</li>
        </ul>
